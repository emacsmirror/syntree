1 Introduction
**************

‘syntree’ is a package for GNU Emacs that draws plain text constituency
trees.  It is meant to be for plain text what packages like qtree
(https://www.ctan.org/pkg/qtree) or forest
(https://www.ctan.org/pkg/forest) are for LaTeX, providing only those
features that make sense for the plain text format.

   While it is written with the linguist’s usage in mind, ‘syntree’ can
obviously be used for any sort of tree-like diagram.  Here’s an example
of what you can get from ‘syntree’:

     ("Sentence"
         "_NP:the man"
         ("VP" "Verb:hit"
         ("NP" "T:the" "N:ball")))

           Sentence
        ._____|_____.
        |           |
        NP          VP
     .__|__.    .___|___.
     |_____|    |       |
     the man  Verb      NP
               hit   .__|__.
                     |     |
                     T     N
                    the  ball

   The drawing is done interactively, with the output displayed as you
type:

   It does not provide functionalities such as drawing arrows between
nodes.  Once the tree is drawn, however, arrows are rather easily added
manually with picture-mode
(https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Picture-Mode.html)
(built-in in GNU Emacs).

File: readme-for-info.info,  Node: Create a new tree,  Next: Syntax of the input,  Up: Usage

2.1 Create a new tree
=====================

Upon calling the command ‘syntree’ a new frame is created that is split
in two windows: the upper one visits the *input buffer*, the lower one
visits the *output buffer*.  Both buffers are in ‘syntree-mode’.

   At this point, ‘syntree-mode-map’ is activated in the two buffers
(more on this *note here: The interactive commands.).  The output buffer
will redisplay the tree every time the input buffer has changed and a
valid syntree input is detected in it (or whenever the value of
‘syntree--current-style’ is changed by calling some interactive
command—more on that below).


File: readme-for-info.info,  Node: Syntax of the input,  Next: The interactive commands,  Prev: Create a new tree,  Up: Usage

2.2 Syntax of the input
=======================

The input is a substring of the buffer made up by parentheses and
objects formatted as strings.  This input is ‘read’ as a list.  Thus,
these are valid inputs:

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp (“abc” (“def” “ghi”))

   (“abc” “def” “ghi”) #+end_src emacs-lisp

   Every list must contain more than one string.  These are not valid
inputs:

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp “abc” “def” ; this is not a list

   (“abc” (“def” ghi)) ; not everything here is a string

   (“abc” (“def”)) ; the embedded list contains only one string
#+end_src emacs-lisp

   The first string in a list is the label of the branching node.  Here,
the embedded constituent has an empty label:

     ("XP" "abc" ("" "def" "ghi" "X:xyz"))

           XP
       ____|____
      /         \
      |         |
     abc    ____|____
           /    |    \
           |    |    X
          def  ghi  xyz

   Terminal nodes can themselves be labeled: the label and the text are
separated by a ‘:’ (i.e., a colon).  Here some examples of terminals:

      ("" "XP:abcd")  |   |
                      |  XP
                      | abcd
                      |
     -----------------+-------
                      |
      ("" "abcd")     |   |
                      | abcd
                      |
     -----------------+-------
                      |
      ("YP" ":abcd")  |  YP
                      |   |
                      | abcd
                      |
     -----------------+-------
                      |
      ("YP" ":ab:cd") |  YP
                      |   |
                      | ab:cd

   If the label on the terminal node starts with, or is ‘_’, the leaf
will be under some sort of roof.  For linguists, this usually indicates
that the internal syntax of that node is ignored.

     ("DP" "D:a" "_NP:beautiful tree")
     ("DP" "D:a" "_:beautiful tree")

          DP                      DP
     .____|____.             .____|____.
     |         |             |         |
     D        NP             D  .______|_____.
     a  .______|_____.       a  |____________|
        |____________|          beautiful tree
        beautiful tree

   Whether you are under a roof or not, if you want to force the text of
a terminal node or of a label to be on multiple lines, use ‘\n’ in the
input.

     ("Modified \n sentence"
         "NP:the man"
         "_VP:vigorously\nhit the ball")


           Modified
           sentence
        ._____|_____.
        |           |
        NP         VP
     the man  ._____|____.
              |__________|
               vigorously
              hit the ball

   Whether the input string in the buffer is split in different lines or
not, and whether it is indented in any way or not is irrelevant.

2.3 The interactive commands
============================

These are all the commands that are available in ‘syntree-mode’ buffers,
each with the default keybinding.  You can define your own keybindings
in ‘syntree-mode-map’.

* Menu:

2.3.1 syntree-change-value (C-c C-v)
------------------------------------

Change the value of any *note properties: Properties, with completion,
and redisplay the tree according to the new value.

   Note that changing values this way does not change the value of the
property in the current style, neither permanently nor for the duration
of the Emacs session.  The value is simply temporarily overwritten.  If,
after changing a value you reset the style, the change will be
discarded.

2.3.2 syntree-increase-padding (M-<right>) and syntree-reduce-padding (M-<left>)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Increase and reduce (if possible) the value of ‘:hspace’ (see *note
properties: Properties.).

   Note that changing values this way does not change the value of the
property in the current style, neither permanently nor for the duration
of the Emacs session.  The value is simply temporarily overwritten.  If,
after changing a value you reset the style, the change will be
discarded.

2.3.3 syntree-increase-height (M-<down>) and syntree-reduce-height (M-<up>)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Increase and reduce (if possible) the value of ‘:height’ (see *note
properties: Properties.).

   Note that changing values this way does not change the value of the
property in the current style, neither permanently nor for the duration
of the Emacs session.  The value is simply temporarily overwritten.  If,
after changing a value you reset the style, the change will be
discarded.

2.3.4 syntree-change-style (C-c C-v)
------------------------------------

Select a different style defined in ‘syntree-styles-list’, with
completion, as the current one, and redisplay the tree.

   What the current style is right after ‘syntree’ is called is
determined by the value of ‘syntree-default-style’ (more on this *note
here: Change default style.).

2.3.5 syntree-done (C-c C-c)
----------------------------

Once you are satisfied with how the tree looks like, you can call
‘syntree-done’: the input and the output (the source for the tree and
the tree itself) are added to the kill ring (in that order), the two
syntree buffers and their dedicated frame are killed, and point is back
in the position it was when ‘syntree’ was called.  You can now yank the
tree.

3 Controlling the design of the tree
************************************

‘syntree’ produces a tree according to a specific style.  A style is a
plist that associates properties to values.  Interactively, one can
switch between *note predefined styles: Define new styles.

* Properties::
* Built-in styles::
* Define new styles::
* Change default style::


File: readme-for-info.info,  Node: Properties,  Next: Built-in styles,  Up: Controlling the design of the tree

3.1 Properties
==============

The properties defining how a tree looks like can be divided in two: the
first group has booleans, integers or symbols as value, the second has
strings or characters.  We first examine the first group.

* Menu:

* growing::
* oneline::
* hspace::
* height::
* roofwidth::
* roofminwidth::
* word-wrap::
* String or character properties::


File: readme-for-info.info,  Node: growing,  Next: oneline,  Up: Properties

3.1.1 :growing
--------------

This property accepts one of these four *symbols* as value:

   • ‘down’
   • ‘up’
   • ‘right’
   • ‘left’

   It determines the direction of growth of the tree: for example, if
the value is ‘right’, the root of the tree will be to the left and the
tree will horizontally grow to the right.


File: readme-for-info.info,  Node: oneline,  Next: hspace,  Prev: growing,  Up: Properties

3.1.2 :oneline
--------------

This property has a boolean value.

   If it is ‘t’, it means that all terminal nodes will be aligned
(horizontally or vertically depending on the value of *note growing::).


File: readme-for-info.info,  Node: hspace,  Next: height,  Prev: oneline,  Up: Properties

3.1.3 :hspace
-------------

This property accepts an integer as value.

   It determines the amount of space between two sister nodes.  It can
be increased or reduced interactively with ‘syntree-increase-padding’
and ‘syntree-reduce-padding’.

   Values smaller than 1 are interpreted as the smallest graphically
viable value.

   Note that if the tree grows horizontally, ‘:hspace’ ends up
determining vertical space between nodes.


File: readme-for-info.info,  Node: height,  Next: roofwidth,  Prev: hspace,  Up: Properties

3.1.4 :height
-------------

This property accepts an integer as value.

   It determines the length of the stem connecting mother and daughter
nodes.  It can be increased or reduced interactively with
‘syntree-increase-height’ and ‘syntree-reduce-height’.

   Values smaller than 1 are interpreted as the smallest graphically
viable value.

   Note that if the tree grows horizontally, ‘:height’ ends up
determining a horizontal dimension despite its name.


File: readme-for-info.info,  Node: roofwidth,  Next: roofminwidth,  Prev: height,  Up: Properties

3.1.5 :roofwidth
----------------

This property accepts an integer as value.

   A positive value means that the roof will be larger than the text
under it, a negative one, shorter.

     :roofwidth 0

         |
     .___|___.
     |_______|
     long leaf

     :roofwidth 2

           |
     ._____|_____.
     |___________|
       long leaf

     :roofwidth -1

         |
      .__|__.
      |_____|
     long leaf


File: readme-for-info.info,  Node: roofminwidth,  Next: word-wrap,  Prev: roofwidth,  Up: Properties

3.1.6 :roofminwidth
-------------------

This property accepts an integer as value.

   It determines what the minimal width of a roof is.  If its value is,
say, ‘5’, no roof will be drawn (despite what the input is) if the width
of the text under it and the value of *note roofwidth:: determine that
it would have to be less than ‘5’ characters wide.

   Values smaller than 1 are interpreted as the smallest graphically
viable value.


File: readme-for-info.info,  Node: word-wrap,  Next: String or character properties,  Prev: roofminwidth,  Up: Properties

3.1.7 :word-wrap
----------------

This property accepts an integer as value.

   A value smaller than 1 means that strings in the input are never
broken in different lines except at new line characters.  Any other
value causes the string to be word wrapped at that given length: for
instance, a value of 4 will cause the string “young boy” to be split in
two.

     :word-wrap 0

         |
     young boy

     :word-wrap 4

       |
     young
      boy

   Note that depending on the value of *note growing::, the wrapped text
will have different apperance.  If the trees grows vertically, the text
is centered.  If it grows horizontally, it is flushed left or right:

     :word-wrap 4
     :growing right

     ---young
        boy

     :word-wrap 4
     :growing left

     young
       boy--


File: readme-for-info.info,  Node: String or character properties,  Prev: word-wrap,  Up: Properties

3.1.8 String or character properties
------------------------------------

These are all properties that determine which character is used to draw
each part of the tree.  The values can be strings (containing one
character) or single characters.

   Below is an example tree (vertical, growing down) that illustrates
which component of the tree is associated with which property.

     :hbranch "1"
     :branchcenter "2"
     :intersection "3"

3.2 Built-in styles
===================

‘syntree’ comes with four built-styles to provide you with a basis to
define your own (see *note here: Define new styles.).  That is, the
predefined value of ‘syntree-styles-list’ is:

     '((:name basic
              :der nil
              :growing down

3.3 Define new styles
=====================

Defining a new style is a matter of adding a new properly constructed
plist to the list ‘syntree-styles-list’.

   There are *two special properties* that must be defined in every
style:

   • ‘:name’
   • ‘:der’

   Both accept a symbol as value.  ‘:name’ specifies the name of the
style, ‘:der’ specifies the name of the style from which the present one
derives.

   For example, say that I want to define a new style, ‘new-horizontal,’
that is identical to the built in one named ‘horizontal’ except for two
things: I want trees in ‘new-horizontal’ style to grow from right to
left and to have all terminals of the tree be aligned.

   The briefest way to define ‘new-horizontal’ is thus:

     (add-to-list
      'syntree-styles-list
      '(:name new-horizontal
        :der horizontal
        :one-line t
        :growing left))

   All properties that are not defined in ‘new-horizontal’ are looked up
in ‘horizontal’.

   If the value of ‘:der’ is ‘nil’, then *all of the properties*
described in *note properties: Properties. *must be defined*.

3.4 Change default style
========================

By default, ‘basic’ is the style that trees are designed according to
when ‘syntree’ is called.  If you want ‘new-horizontal’ (the one defined
*note here: Define new styles.) to be the default, set the value of
‘syntree-default-style’ accordingly:

     (setq syntree-default-style 'new-horizontal)
